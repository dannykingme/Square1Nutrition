						<h2>Meet Jennifer.</h2>
						<p><span>My passion is healing.</span> My focus has always been encouraging the people around me to find their higher purpose, to recognize their gifts and their beauty; to be the best version of themselves.</p>
						<p>This path into a healthy lifestyle has been long and difficult at times. I feel a deep compassion for those traveling the same roads through similar circumstances. My journey has uncovered many simple, yet unique health practices.</p>
						<p>Today, I am the healthiest version of myself. With my certification from both The Institute for Integrative Nutrition and The American Association of Drugless Practitioners (AADP) my goal is to help others find the same fulfillment in their own lives.</p>
